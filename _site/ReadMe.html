<h2>Uses &amp; Notes</h2>
<p>I have found it useful and fun to study the bible in my code editor; using project search, file fuzzy search, and even a dash of ASCII art to jump around in translations, journaling, and adding margin-notes in line in an indexable way. </p>
<p>Using a tool like <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> you can convert this into other formats as needed.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview">sublimetext-markdown-preview</a> to open text in the browser where it is easy to highlight a passage and have a screen reader read aloud (alt+esc on MacOS).</p>
<p>Each file ends with an end-of-file &quot;eof&quot; tag to indicate its end; it's an intentional marker I find useful to denote the end of the content of the book.</p>
